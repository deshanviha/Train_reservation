   <img src="images/imgMatara.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="" class="center"><br>
   <div class="center">Matara is a busy town booming with commercial activities.
      Situated 160 kilometers from the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, the coastal town may not feature highly

      may not seem like an attractive tourist landmark in Matara. However, that does not mean that Matara
         holds next to negligible tourist value. The Nilwala River cuts through the city of Matara forming
         stunning views along its path. The river falls into the Indian Ocean at Totamuna. Additionally, 
         the beachfront paints beautiful scenes along the coast of the city.
